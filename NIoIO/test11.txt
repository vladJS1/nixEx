HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
					William Butler YeatsHello chel

There are only two ways to live your life.One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is asthough everything is a miracle.
